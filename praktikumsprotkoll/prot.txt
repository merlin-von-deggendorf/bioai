-Softmax
-Embedding: Token,Positional

-Autoencoder
    Programming of two different autoencoders, one is based on a substitution matrix the other one
    should be based on electrochemical properties.

        Electrochemical properties:
            are taken from the AAindex database. Those properties are then reduced in dimensionality
        substitution matrix:
            a substitution matrix is calculated and used to encode the amino acids.

        The performance of both methods will be compared.
