Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in this context:
HMMs are statistical models that represent systems where the true state is not directly observable, but you can observe related outputs (in this case, the protein sequence).
For protein sequences, HMMs are used to recognize patterns within sequences that correspond to known functional features. These features may include domains, motifs, or other biologically relevant regions that determine a protein's role or function.
A library of HMMs is essentially a collection of these models, each one trained to identify a specific type of functional annotation (e.g., enzyme activity, binding domains).
Thus, by comparing protein sequences to this library, the function of a given protein can be predicted based on how well it matches the models for known functional features.

In summary, the HMM library helps annotate protein sequences with functional descriptions, such as whether the protein binds to other molecules or catalyzes a reaction, by comparing sequence patterns to those learned from previously annotated proteins.
